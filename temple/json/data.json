         "facts": "The Idaho Falls Idaho Temple was the first temple built in Idaho.  Several temples received angels after their dedications. The first was the Idaho Falls Idaho Temple, which had an angel Moroni statue added in 1983, almost 40 years after its dedication. The design of the Idaho Falls Idaho Temple was inspired by a vision of an ancient Nephite temple beheld by architect John Fetzer, Sr., who had prayed for guidance. Once the exterior of the temple was completed in September 1941, the interior was expected to be completed by the end of the next year. However, World War II shortages delayed completion of the temple four more years."

Once the statue was in place, the throngs of visitors broke into applause and then spontaneously began to sing The Spirit of God."

These are the guarantors of our independence and our liberty. We pray for this nation of which we are part. Preserve the freedom of the people now and for generations to come. May these blessings rest upon its citizens without restraint or hindrance of any kind.\""
